 use aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.
 must use GROUP BY

group by must use the SELECT column 
SELECT product_id, SUM(price) AS Total
FROM item 
where product_id = 1
GROUP BY product_id; <--- product_id if using the total does not work

product_id   total
1	           656.44


SELECT product_id,size, SUM(price) AS Total
FROM item 
where product_id = 1
GROUP BY product_id, size; <---- product_id and size

product_id    size              total
1	            8(different)	    139.73
1	            9(different)      119.61
1	            10(different)	    114.36
1	            12(different)	    282.74

the group by will find the different and group them into individual group
