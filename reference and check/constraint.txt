Constraints in a database enforce rules on columns to ensure data integrity.


Key types include:

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row.
Foreign Key: Links tables, ensuring referential integrity.
Unique: Enforces uniqueness in specified columns.
Check: Validates data against conditions.
Not Null: Ensures a column doesn't contain null values.
Constraints maintain data consistency, prevent errors, and support 

if you don't provide one explicitly name.

In PostgreSQL, when create a foreign key constraint on a column, 
the system automatically generates a default name for that constraint

The default name is constructed based on a combination of the table name,
column name, and a suffix that indicates the type of constraint.

<referencing_table>_<referencing_column>_<suffix>

Breaking it down:

product_type: The name of the referenced table.
id: The name of the referenced column.
fkey: A suffix indicating that it's a foreign key constraint.
