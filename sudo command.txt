To connect to a PostgreSQL database, typically use the following syntax:
Replace username, dbname, host, and port with your actual database credentials.

psql -U username -d dbname -h host -p port

or

psql -U username  -d dbname 

or 

psql -d dbname 

if username matches system username:  
psql

back to postgres user
postgres=# \q 

list of database
postgres=# \l

switch database
postgres=# \c dbname

list tables
postgres=# \dt

change password
postgres=# \password sde

info about the database: port user location
postgres=# \conninfo

change owner
postgres=# ALTER DATABASE {database name} OWNER TO postgres;


to grant these privileges to your user:
postgres=# GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, INDEX, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

most cases should be enough, add privilege only if needed, can search online mysql privileges list
postgres=# GRANT {privilege, like above create etc....} on *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;


free up any memory that the server cached as a result of the preceding CREATE USER and GRANT statements:
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Then you can exit the MySQL client:

exit
