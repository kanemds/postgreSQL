DELETE FROM table_name


or 

DELETE FROM customer
WHERE email = 'john@gmail.com';

or 

TRUNCATE TABLE your_table_name;

Speed: TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE as it minimizes undo and redo log generation.

Reset Identity Columns: TRUNCATE resets the associated sequence for serial or identity columns.

Cannot Be Rolled Back: Unlike DELETE, TRUNCATE is not transaction-safe and cannot be rolled back.

Permissions: The user executing TRUNCATE needs the TRUNCATE privilege on the table.
