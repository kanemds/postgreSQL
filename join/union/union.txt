the selected columns must have the same data types 
and in the same order

UNION requires the columns to be matched.

example both selected column are in the same order

SELECT first_name, last_name,street, city, zip, birth_date
FROM customer
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) = 12
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name,street, city, zip, birth_date
FROM sales_person
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth_date) = 12
ORDER BY birth_date;


both customer and sales_person on the same list
results:
